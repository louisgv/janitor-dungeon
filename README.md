## Janitor Dungeon
Your home turf is being invaded by scary square thingy! Gather your community and battle them with engagement and more!

## Diversifiers

+ Power of Community - (Sponsored by Mixer) - Make a game where community impacts your game. Players, viewers or streamers can enhance the game, change the outcome, or be a unifying force.

+ Use the Source, Luke - (Sponsored by GitHub) - Use one or more open source tools, game engines or libraries in your game (and thank them in in the Technology Notes section on the submission page).

+ Thomas Wasn't Alone - Use only simple shapes (cubes, triangles, circles, etc.) to represent every single element (characters, HUD, etc.) inside the game.

+ Assetless - Create all visuals programmatically or in the scene editor, and avoid any importing of image files, sprite sheets, 3D models etc.
